# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java, developed throughout my Computer Science course at Dom Helder CÃ¢mara. The goal of this repository is to store, organize, and showcase my progress in learning and applying DSA concepts.

## Contents

### âœ… DSA I
- Basics of Java and Programming
- Algorithms Solving skills and analisys
- Basic Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists)
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms

### ðŸ”œ DSA II (Coming Soon)

### ðŸ”œ DSA III (Coming Soon)

## Usage
The codes are written in Java and can be compiled and executed using a Java compiler.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms while enhancing my Java programming skills.
