# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository contains my implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java, developed throughout my Computer Science course at Dom Helder Câmara. The goal of this repository is to store, organize, and showcase my progress in learning and applying DSA concepts.

## Contents

### ✅ DSA I
- Basics of Java and Programming
- Algorithms Solving skills and analisys
- Basic Data Structures (Arrays, Linked Lists)
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms

## Usage
The codes are written in Java and can be compiled and executed using a Java compiler.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to document my learning journey in Data Structures and Algorithms while enhancing my Java programming skills. **It is intended for learning purposes only and should not be used to cheat in school or academic assessments.**
